# Feature Request: Add Video Filters

## Description

I would like to request the addition of video filters to the TikTok Clone App. Video filters would enhance the user experience by allowing users to apply various filters to their uploaded videos, making them more engaging and fun to watch.

## Benefits

- **Enhanced User Engagement:** Video filters are popular on social media platforms and can attract more users to the app.
- **Creative Expression:** Users can express their creativity by applying unique filters to their videos.
- **Competitive Advantage:** Many video-sharing apps offer filters, and adding this feature would keep our app competitive.

## Proposed Implementation

1. Integrate a selection of filters that users can choose from when uploading a video.
2. Implement a user-friendly interface to apply and preview filters in real-time.
3. Ensure that the selected filter is applied to the video before it's displayed in the feed.

## Additional Notes

I believe that implementing video filters would greatly enhance the overall user experience of the app and encourage users to share more creative content. I'm excited about the potential of this feature and would be happy to provide further input and assistance during its development.

Thank you for considering my feature request.
